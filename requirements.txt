To ensure your Python environment has all necessary packages for the project, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
tk
```

### Explanation:

- **pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training and prediction.
- **joblib**: For saving and loading the trained ML model.
- **tk**: Tkinter GUI library (usually comes pre-installed with Python on Windows; including here for completeness).

### How to use `requirements.txt`:

1. Save the above lines in a file named `requirements.txt` in your project folder.
2. Open your terminal or VS Code terminal.
3. Run the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all required packages automatically.

If you face any issues with Tkinter installation, note that on Windows it is usually included with Python. If missing, you may need to reinstall Python with the Tkinter option enabled.
